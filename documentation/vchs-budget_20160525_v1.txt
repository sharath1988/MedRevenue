Subject:	Production Database Modification vchs-budget_20160525_v1

Date of Request:
5/25/2016
 
Requested date/time of the release:
As soon as doable.
 
What database needs to be modified?
Vchs-budget 
 
Reason(s) for the change ? Redo of stored proc. This will take care of the stale data issues.

Does this affect a TableSync job? No
 
Before the release should the entire database be backed up  ? No.
 
Before the release should specific database tables be backed up ? No.


List the step-by-step release process.


Run these commands from top to bottom in the vchs-budget DB:

drop procedure [dbo].[p_check_budget]
/

CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[p_check_budget] (
    @DataTable BudgetValueTableType READONLY,
    @LineItemId int,
    @datagroupId int
    )
/* this proc checks to make sure values exist in the budget and budgetValue tables.
    It also inserts the value into the budgetValue table
*/
AS

BEGIN
DECLARE @missionId int;

    -- get missionId from @DataTable
    SET @missionId = ( SELECT TOP 1 missionId FROM @DataTable );
    -- set calculcatedValue to zero
    UPDATE bv
    SET bv.CalculatedValue = 0
    FROM dbo.BudgetValue bv 
    INNER JOIN budget b ON bv.BudgetId=b.BudgetId
    WHERE bv.LineItemId = @LineItemId
    AND bv.MissionId = @missionId
    AND b.datagroupId = @datagroupId

                -- insert into budgetValue if necessary
                INSERT INTO
                                [vchs-budget].dbo.BudgetValue (BudgetId, LineItemId, MissionId, CalculatedValue)
                SELECT
                                b.BudgetId, @LineItemId, tmp.missionId, tmp.input_amount
                FROM
                                [vchs-budget].dbo.Budget b,
                                @DataTable tmp
                WHERE
                                b.DivisionId = tmp.divisionId AND b.datagroupId = tmp.datagroupId AND
                                NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM BudgetValue WHERE BudgetId = b.BudgetId AND 
LineItemId = @LineItemId AND MissionId = tmp.missionId and b.datagroupId = tmp.datagroupId);

    /* now update BudgetValue with the appropriate values */
                UPDATE
                                bv
                SET
                                bv.CalculatedValue = tmp.input_amount
    FROM [vchs-budget].dbo.BudgetValue bv
                JOIN [vchs-budget].dbo.Budget b ON b.BudgetId = bv.BudgetId AND b.datagroupId = 
@datagroupId
                JOIN @DataTable tmp ON tmp.divisionId = b.DivisionId and tmp.datagroupId = @datagroupId
                WHERE
                                bv.MissionId = tmp.missionId 
        AND bv.LineItemId = @LineItemId;
