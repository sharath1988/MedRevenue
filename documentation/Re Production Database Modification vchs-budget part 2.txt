Requested date/time of the release:
As soon as doable.
 
What database needs to be modified?
Vchs-budget
 
Reason(s) for the change ? two views need to be recreated. This needs to be done before the 
application release which will follow. If for some reason these queries fail, don’t release the new 
application.
 
Does this affect a TableSync job? No
 
Before the release should the entire database be backed up  ? No.
 
Before the release should specific database tables be backed up ? No.
List the step-by-step release process.
 
2 sql files are in: (check date to make sure they are dated at 4/28/2016)
 
‘/mnt/nwserver/dmgdb/BADG/ApplicationDevelopment/Files/ToBeDeployed/vchs-budget/vchs-
budget.commit.sql’
‘/mnt/nwserver/dmgdb/BADG/ApplicationDevelopment/Files/ToBeDeployed/vchs-budget/vchs-
budget.rollback.sql’
 
 
1.	In the vchs-budget DB on the ms production server, run the vchs-budget.commit.sql . It has a 
drop command and then a create command for two views. (total of 4 commands) If it fails, run 
the 2nd command: vchs-budget.rollback.sql
 
 
Is this part of an application update/release ?
No.
 
What testing was done to ensure the success of this release?
Testing was done on dev and qa
 
Describe how to determine the success of the release
Run this query.  You should get around 280-290 rows
 
1.	In the vchs-budget DB on the ms production server run ‘select NetExcludingReserves from 
v_BudgetTotal’
