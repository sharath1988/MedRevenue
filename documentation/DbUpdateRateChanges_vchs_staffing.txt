Subject: Production Database Modification Request {vchs-staffing}

Request for Production Database Modification
 
Date of Request:  3/21/2016
 
Requested date/time of the release: 
As soon as reasonable pending approval from Cheryl. 
 
What database needs to be modified? vchs-staffing in Production SQL Server
 
Reason(s) for the change ? We need to update the effective rates for bargaining units based on 
FY 17 received to us by HR via Rose.
 
Does this affect a TableSync job?
No
 
Before the release should the entire database be backed up  ? No
 
 
Before the release should specific database tables be backed up ? No
 
 
List the step-by-step release process. 

USE [vchs-staffing]
GO
UPDATE ACAD_STAFFING_BARG_UNIT_EFF_RATE SET rate_increase = .03 WHERE code = 'EX'
GO
UPDATE ACAD_STAFFING_BARG_UNIT_EFF_RATE SET rate_increase = .00 WHERE code = 'CX'
GO
UPDATE ACAD_STAFFING_BARG_UNIT_EFF_RATE SET rate_increase = .02 WHERE code = 'NX'
GO
UPDATE ACAD_STAFFING_BARG_UNIT_EFF_RATE SET rate_increase = .02 WHERE code = 'SX'
GO
UPDATE ACAD_STAFFING_BARG_UNIT_EFF_RATE SET rate_increase = .02 WHERE code = 'TX'
GO
UPDATE ACAD_STAFFING_BARG_UNIT_EFF_RATE SET rate_increase = .01 WHERE code = 'HX'
GO

 
Is this part of an application update/release ? No
 
What testing was done to ensure the success of this release? 
Functional testing was performed in the QA Environment. 

 
Describe how to determine the success of the release: 
Compare the results of the following query:
USE [vchs-staffing]
GO
SELECT * FROM ACAD_STAFFING_BARG_UNIT_EFF_RATE
GO

to the data table we received from Rose (NOTE: There are additional Bargaining Unit codes in our table 
that are not in Rose’s table.  This is OK.  Only compare the ones in this list):

 
FY17 wage increase
Bargaining Unit
Calculated 
rates
