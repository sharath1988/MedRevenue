Sorry for the false alarm.  Here is the modified script:

/**

* 
 * Provides a unique list of medgrp divisions
*/
create or replace view budget.v_medgrp_revenue_division as
select distinct division_id from budget.v_medgrp_revenue_worksheet
union all
select 1 from dual
GO

/*
* V_EMPLOYEE_DIVISION
* 
 * View for displaying a list of MedGrp divisions on the landing screen.
* Only displays divisions that have active indexes in the index map
* with a group area = 'MedGrp'.  
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: Returns employeeUcsdId so we can list only the revenue
* divisions they have access to
* 
 * NOTE: Doing a RIGHT OUTER JOIN on emp_divisions to pull in Anes records
*/
create or replace view budget.v_employee_division_base as
select distinct 
    concat('MedGrp', '-', cast(ei.employee_ucsd_id as char), '-', cast(ei.division_id 
as char)) as id,

Request for Production Database Modification

Date of Request:  5/28/2015

Requested date/time of the release: 
Please deploy as soon as reasonably possible.  This is an urgent release.

What database needs to be modified? budget

Reason(s) for the change ? Urology was not showing up on the medgrp revenue summary list 
because I was joining against index map to display the department and division names.  Urology 
is now division 32.  However, in mgfs, Urology is division 206 so this division was being 
excluded.  Now I am conditionally joining against index_map and displaying labels from 
som_rollup ONLY IF they don’t exist in the index map.

Does this affect a TableSync job? 
No.


Before the release should the entire database be backed up  ? No

Before the release should specific database tables be backed up ? No


List the step-by-step release process. 

Execute the following SQL in SomProd4 budget database:

use budget
GO

/**

*

Is this part of an application update/release ? No

What testing was done to ensure the success of this release? 
Tested the following use case in Qa4
1.	Log into http://som-qa4.ucsd.edu/medgrp-revenue with the budget_admin role
2.	In the “Div Id” field, type ‘206’
3.	Verify Urology is returned in the results
4.	Click on the Division Id Field for Urology and verify the revenue worksheet is displayed


Describe how to determine the success of the release: 
1.	Execute this query and verify that 9 records are returned:
select * from v_employee_division where division_id=206
/

2.	Log into http://som-prod4.ucsd.edu/medgrp-revenue with the budget_admin role
3.	In the “Div Id” field, type ‘206’
4.	Verify Urology is returned in the results
5.	Click on the Division Id Field for Urology and verify the revenue worksheet is displayed

Provide SVN location where this document should be saved. 
svn+ssh://som-util01.ucsd.edu/opt/svnroot/medgrp-revenue/trunk/documentation
Should any databases or tables be removed as a result of these changes?
No.
