Date of Request:
5/19/2016
 
Requested date/time of the release:
As soon as doable.
 
What database needs to be modified?
Vchs-budget 
 
Reason(s) for the change ? stale data in lineitem=105, DG=1 is stale and needs to be redone. 

Does this affect a TableSync job? No
 
Before the release should the entire database be backed up  ? No.
 
Before the release should specific database tables be backed up ? no.
List the step-by-step release process.


Run these commands in the vchs-budget DB:

update bv
set bv.CalculatedValue =0
from dbo.BudgetValue bv 
inner join budget b on bv.BudgetId=b.BudgetId
where bv.LineItemId = 105
and b.datagroupId = 1
/
exec p_fetch_medgrp_staffing
/


Is this part of an application update/release ?
No.
 
What testing was done to ensure the success of this release?

Describe how to determine the success of the release

This query should also return one row, or if two rows, very very close:

SELECT
        CAST(SUM(total_annual_salary)  AS DECIMAL(24,4)) AS input_amount
    FROM [vchs-budget].dbo.V_MEDGRP_STAFFING_BY_DIV
    where FinManLineItemId IN (105)
    and division_id is not null
union
select 
sum(bv.CalculatedValue) as input_amount
from BudgetValue bv 
inner join Budget b on bv.BudgetId=b.BudgetId
where bv.LineItemId = 105
and b.datagroupId=1
and bv.MissionId = 2
