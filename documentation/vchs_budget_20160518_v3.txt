Subject:	Production Database Modification vchs-budget # 3

Date of Request:
5/18/2016
 
Requested date/time of the release:
As soon as doable.
 
What database needs to be modified?
Vchs-budget 
 
Reason(s) for the change ? This is a fix to include zero out values from CPO expense budget detail 
table.  Landing page was not updating them back to zero because they were being excluded from the 
view.

Does this affect a TableSync job? No
 
Before the release should the entire database be backed up  ? No.
 
Before the release should specific database tables be backed up ? no.
List the step-by-step release process.

USE [vchs-budget]

    DROP VIEW [dbo].V_MEDGRP_EXPENSE

What testing was done to ensure the success of this release?
Testing was done on dev and qa
 
Describe how to determine the success of the release


use [vchs-budget]
GO
exec p_fetch_mgfs
/

Following Query should return zero rows
select * from Budget b
join BudgetValue v on v.BudgetId = b.BudgetId
where v.LineItemId = 201 and b.datagroupId = 1 and DivisionId = 6
and CalculatedValue <> 0 
/
