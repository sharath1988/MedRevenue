Subject: Production Database Modification vchs-budget

Date of Request:
4/14/2016
 
Requested date/time of the release:
As soon as doable.
 
What database needs to be modified?
Vchs-budget
 
Reason(s) for the change ? Two views need to be dropped and recreated. 
V_datagroup_summary_stage and v_datagroup_summary
Does this affect a TableSync job? No
 
Before the release should the entire database be backed up  ? No.
 
Before the release should specific database tables be backed up ? No.
List the step-by-step release process.

2 sql files are in:

‘/mnt/nwserver/dmgdb/BADG/ApplicationDevelopment/Files/ToBeDeployed/vchs-budget/vchs-
budget.commit.sql’
‘/mnt/nwserver/dmgdb/BADG/ApplicationDevelopment/Files/ToBeDeployed/vchs-budget/vchs-
budget.rollback.sql’
 

1.	In the vchs-budget DB on the ms production server, run the vchs-budget.commit.sql . It has a 
drop command and then a create command for each of the two views. If it fails, run the 2nd 
command: vchs-budget.rollback.sql
 
 
Is this part of an application update/release ?
Yes, release document to follow.
 
What testing was done to ensure the success of this release?
Table values confirmed on dev, qa. DB from prod was dumped onto dev and the above commands were 
run with great success.
 
 
Describe how to determine the success of the release: do a select * from v_datagroup_summary and 
you should see the divisionId column. This is new.
