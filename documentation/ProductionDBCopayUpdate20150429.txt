Request for Production Database Modification
 
Date of Request: 4/28/2015
 
Requested date/time of the release: 
Close of business on Tuesday 4/28/2015 or first thing in the morning of Wednesday 4/29/2015. 
 
What database needs to be modified? budget
 
Reason(s) for the change ? The reason for this change is to set projected copay amounts to zero 
where projected copay amounts match prior year copay amounts.  This is due to incorrect prior 
year copay amounts being set as projected copay for FY2016 when revenue data was first 
loaded.  It appears this is due to an issue in EPIC.
 
Does this affect a TableSync job? 
No 
 
 
Before the release should the entire database be backed up  ? No
 
Before the release should specific database tables be backed up ?  Yes, 
budget.medgrp_revenue_payment_information
 
 
List the step-by-step release process. 
Execute the following SQL in SomProd4: 
 
update budget.medgrp_revenue_payment_information p
join 
    ( select division_id, prior_copay, sos from budget.v_medgrp_revenue_payment_information
       union all
       select division_id, prior_copay, sos from budget.v_medgrp_revenue_payment_information_psych
       ) v
on v.division_id = p.division_id and v.sos = p.sos
set p.proj_copay = 0
where p.proj_copay = v.prior_copay
/
 
Verify 63 results were updated.
 
Is this part of an application update/release ? No
 
What testing was done to ensure the success of this release? 
I tested this in both the development and QA environment and verified divisions that have set 
projected copays did not get overwritten.
 
Describe how to determine the success of the release: 
1.	Log into the medgrp revenue application with the budget_admin role (http://som-
prod4.ucsd.edu/medgrp-revenue)
2.	From the division list, select Orthopedic Surgery
3.	Scroll down to the “Payment Information” section on the worksheet and verify projected 
copay amount is $167,700
4.	No go back to the Revenue Homepage and select “Cardiology” from the division list
5.	Scroll down to the “Payment Information” section on the worksheet and verify projected 
copay amount is $0.00
Provide SVN location where this document should be saved. 
/svnroot/medgrp-revenue/trunk/documentation 
 
Should any databases or tables be removed as a result of these changes? No
