I forgot to specify the database where this was to be recreated. It is in the dw database, not the budget 
database. I have updated the instructions below.

Requested date/time of the release:
As soon as reasonable
 
What database needs to be modified?
dw
 
Reason(s) for the change ? the view: dw.all_employee_view is querying on a view which should be 
switched to a table. This will speed up queries in the landing page app and anywhere else this view is 
used.
 
Does this affect a TableSync job?
No.
 
Before the release should the entire database be backed up  ?
No
 
Before the release should specific database tables be backed up ?
No
 
List the step-by-step release process.

/* these instructions are updated as of 9 march 12pm */

On each of the mysql servers run these two commands:
 
drop view if exists dw.all_employee_view
/ 
drop view if exists budget.all_employee_view
/

Is this part of an application update/release ?
No
 
What testing was done to ensure the success of this release?
Table values confirmed on dev, qa and prod. The rows and columns returned from this modified view 
are exactly the same as the original view. It is just faster. 
 
 
Describe how to determine the success of the release:
Run this command:
explain select *
from dw.all_employee_view
 
you should get 4 rows back. Try the command on a server where you did not replace the view and you 
get this:
and you get 6 rows back and you can see this view is inferior in terms of performance.
