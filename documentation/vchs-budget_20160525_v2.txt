Before the release should specific database tables be backed up ? No.


List the step-by-step release process.


Run these commands from top to bottom in the vchs-budget DB:

drop procedure [dbo].[p_fetch_dept_clinical_benefit]
/

CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[p_fetch_dept_clinical_benefit]
AS BEGIN
/* this proc gets lineItemId=109 for DG=0 and DG=1
    DG=0 is negative and DG=1 is positive
*/
DECLARE @DataTable AS BudgetValueTableType;
DECLARE @LineItemId int;
DECLARE @datagroupId int;
DECLARE @missionId int;
SET @datagroupId = 0;
SET @LineItemId = 109;
SET @missionId = 2;

    -- ---------- START AHS
    INSERT INTO @DataTable(missionId, divisionId, input_amount, datagroupId)
    select @missionId as missionId, divisionId, 
        sum(input_amount) as input_amount,
       @datagroupId as datagroupId
    from [vchs-budget].dbo.v_refresh_109
    group by divisionId
    order by divisionId;

    /* call the proc: [dbo].[p_check_budget] to make sure
        the budget table and the budgetValue table have the existing
        values */ 

    -- NOW multiply by -1 for AHS as it is negative
    UPDATE @DataTable set input_amount = input_amount * -1;
    exec [dbo].[p_check_budget] @DataTable, @LineItemId, @datagroupId;
    --  ---------- DONE AHS
    delete from @DataTable;
    -- NOW multiply by -1 again for the MEDGRP as it is positive
    SET @datagroupId = 1;

    INSERT INTO @DataTable(missionId, divisionId, input_amount, datagroupId)
    select @missionId as missionId, v.divisionId, sum(input_amount) + manAdj as input_amount, 
@datagroupId as datagroupId

        join BudgetValue bv on bv.BudgetId = b.BudgetId
        join FinManStaging.dbo.somMgDivisionView dv on dv.somDivisionId = b.DivisionId
        where b.datagroupId = 0 and bv.LineItemId = 109
        and dv.somMajorGroupId not in (8,14,17,5,16,26,40,41,42,43)
